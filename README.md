Generate a Custom Avatar:
Users input details like height, weight, gender, age, cap size, shoe size, and other optional information (e.g., hair color, eye color).
The website uses these inputs to generate a faceless, full-body avatar that represents the user.

Purpose of the Avatar:
The avatar is intended to help users visualize how clothing items will fit them.
Once the avatar is generated, users can upload clothing items (e.g., shirts, pants) and see how they look on the avatar, simulating how the clothes would fit in real life.
Future Try-On Feature(We are implementing this now):
After generating the avatar, the website will allow users to upload clothing items and overlay them on the avatar to see how they fit.
